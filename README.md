# PhysGauss-SDE

Research prototype for physically constrained Gaussian scene reconstruction from **one moving camera with missing frames**.

The initial milestone is a small, reproducible CPU experiment. It is not a reproduction of PIDG or a completed real-video reconstruction system. We separate uncertainty over unknown scene parameters from stochastic forcing, and evaluate both against synthetic ground truth.

## Planned runnable first milestone

- Volumetric tetrahedral Neo-Hookean mechanics with fixed material mass and explicit supports.
- Gaussian primitives whose positions and covariances follow the material deformation.
- Known moving camera; deliberately irregular observation times and a contiguous missing interval.
- Image-based inference over stiffness, damping, and initial state.
- A correlated neural diffusion field, trained on an independent synthetic calibration task.
- Joint approximate inference over parameters and latent stochastic increments using observations on both sides of a gap.
- Held-out rendering, trajectory, uncertainty, and physical-consistency metrics.

## Setup

Use Python 3.10 or newer. Install the appropriate PyTorch build for your platform first if needed.

```sh
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/macOS: source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .
```

Run commands and measured results will be added with the implementation milestone.

## Research boundaries

The first benchmark assumes known rest geometry, density, camera poses, and material family. These assumptions deliberately isolate motion inference. Geometry completion, camera estimation, contact inference, and real-video fitting are later milestones. A Gaussian's spatial covariance represents material extent; posterior uncertainty is represented separately.

## Handover

See [HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md) for current status and [docs/RESEARCH.md](docs/RESEARCH.md) for the experimental plan. Development uses small pushed commits. Generated data and large checkpoints are excluded; the repository will include reproducible commands and a compact result summary.
